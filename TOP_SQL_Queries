1)  Write an SQL query to fetch “FIRST_NAME” from the Worker table using the alias name <WORKER_NAME>.
==> Select FIRST_NAME AS WORKER_NAME from Worker;

2)  Write an SQL query to fetch “FIRST_NAME” from the Worker table in upper case.
==> Select upper(FIRST_NAME) from Worker;

3) Write an SQL query to fetch unique values of DEPARTMENT from the Worker table.
==> Select distinct DEPARTMENT from Worker;

4) Write an SQL query to print the first three characters of  FIRST_NAME from the Worker table.
==> Select substring(FIRST_NAME,1,3) from Worker;

5) Write an SQL query to find the position of the alphabet (‘a’) in the first name column ‘Amitabh’ from the Worker table.
==> Select INSTR(FIRST_NAME, BINARY'a') from Worker where FIRST_NAME = 'Amitabh';
      
     - The INSTR does a case-insensitive search.
     - Using the BINARY operator will make INSTR work as the case-sensitive function.

6) Write an SQL query to print the FIRST_NAME from the Worker table after removing white spaces from the right side.
==> Select RTRIM(FIRST_NAME) from Worker;

7) Write an SQL query to print the DEPARTMENT from the Worker table after removing white spaces from the left side.
==> Select LTRIM(DEPARTMENT) from Worker;

8) Write an SQL query that fetches the unique values of DEPARTMENT from the Worker table and prints its length.
==> Select distinct length(DEPARTMENT) from Worker;
